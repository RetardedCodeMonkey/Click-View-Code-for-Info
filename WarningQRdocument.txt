To whom it may concern, 
I, Felix Allison will be using mom's minivan on Thursday, December 21, 2023 from 3:00
post-meridiem until 7:00 post-meridiem at the very earliest. Just so there's no confusion
when I say minivan I am strictly referring to the 2014 Honda Odyssey full of nothing but junk
parked in the Allison residence driveway. For any inqueries please deliver an envelope with your message
inside and seal it with a wax stamp. Thank you for your cooperation.

If your name happens to be Zoe and you need something out of the car, please let me know because mom
told me to offer you the chance to grab your stuff out of the car before I leave.

Felix Allison
